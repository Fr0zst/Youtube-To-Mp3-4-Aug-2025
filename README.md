# YT2MP3-4
I WAS SO BORED. HELP ME



so ik it's people that want a new version, so here I go,



Install Python https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install it with pip. Don't FORGET THAT you nerds



Then open PowerShell and type in pip install pytubefix moviepy==1.0.3

Then you should have all the required modules for the file. After that, run it in the file path


You can do cd (path\to\file\location), then enter, then you can do python YT2MP.py and enter to start up the program


OR


You can open up PowerShell in the file location so you don't have to do the long step

Then the same Python YT2MP.py, then DONE!
